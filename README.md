# Search-in-a-Rotated-Array

Given a sorted and rotated array A of N distinct elements which is rotated at some point, and given an element key. The task is to find the index of the given element key in the array A.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 9
A[] = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3}
key = 10
Output:
5
Explanation: 10 is found at index 5.


Approach: 
1) Find middle point mid = (l + h)/2
2) If key is present at middle point, return mid.
3) Else If arr[l..mid] is sorted
    a) If key to be searched lies in range from arr[l]
       to arr[mid], recur for arr[l..mid].
    b) Else recur for arr[mid+1..h]
4) Else (arr[mid+1..h] must be sorted)
    a) If key to be searched lies in range from arr[mid+1]
       to arr[h], recur for arr[mid+1..h].
    b) Else recur for arr[l..mid] 
    
Time Complexity: O(log n). 
Binary Search requires log n comparisons to find the element. So time complexity is O(log n).
Space Complexity: O(1). 
As no extra space is required.
